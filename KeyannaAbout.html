        <p class="light">
          I am a UC Irvine Graduate (International Finance B.A.), a mother, and a US Army wife with a passion for
          learning and growing as a young adult. My focused skill set is geared towards working as a Full-Stack
          Programmer in a company that yearns to grow and adapt in this ever-changing world of technology. </p>

          <p class="dark"> love technology; always have, and always will. This world has developed at such an exponential rate due to
          the advances in tech in the last few decades and I couldn’t stand by any longer without getting directly
          involved. I decided to pursue Computer Programming in 2017 and began my official studies in 2018 through
          UCLA’s Web Development Bootcamp.</p>

          <p class="light">I have experience with web development tech like JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Node.js, as well as excellent
          customer-service skills, due to my years of experience in the travel industry (I used to be a flight
          attendant because I loved traveling the world). I also excel in team collaboration, leadership and adapting
          to new priorities. Since having my daughter, my priorities have massively changed and I’ve allowed myself to
          pursue a career much more fitting for someone who always like to reach for the stars. </p>
          <p class="dark">
          With a toddler at home, everything is different and I want to gain skills that I can put to work for
          different businesses of all kinds, without leaving the state, or the country.</p>
          <p class="light">I have a passion for numbers, logic, and development and I'm overjoyed to be given the change to be a
          part of your team!
          Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments, I'd love to hear from you!
